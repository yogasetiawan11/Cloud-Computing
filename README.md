# Cloud-Computing

Cloud computing is an on-demand platform that delivers IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

On-demand is a service that we can request and adjust depending on our needs.

IT resources can vary in categories, such as computation, compute power, storage, databases, applications, or other IT infrastructure resources.

These IT resources are provided by big tech companies, e.g., Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. 

The internet plays a very important role, especially in on-demand services, because IT resources are offered through the internet.
With cloud services, we no longer need to worry about maintenance, hardware, or human resources.
We can request IT resources from the provider based on our needs

so we can focus on sofware devlopment or the product 
if we face a problem by purchasing too many IT resources we can easily scale up and scale down 

There are three services offered by cloud providers.

# iaas
iaas stand for infrastructure as a service.
iaas offer compute service, storage service, network service. this model offer high flexibility and control over IT resources

# paas
paas stand for platform as a service.
paas offers runtime environment, database management, and development tools.
This model helps developers focus on building applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

# saas 
saas stand for software as a service.
saas offers ready-to-use applications that run on the provider’s infrastructure.
This model is easy to use and doesn't require installation or maintenance from the user side. 

# advantage-cloud
# 1. budget allocation 
Cloud can convert CAPEX (capital expenditure) into OPEX (operational expenditure).

CAPEX is the funds a company uses to buy assets for investment purposes, such as hardware, upgrades, and maintenance.

With cloud, we can replace upfront investment with a flexible model depending on the IT infrastructure usage that the company needs.

# 2. massive economic of scale
When we use cloud computing, we basically use the global infrastructure provided by cloud providers such as AWS, Google, or Microsoft.
We can use services from providers, which can lead to lower costs.

# 3. stop guessing capacity
in on the premises model, we often face the challeng guessing capacity where we have to estimate infrastructure needed to run our application.
In the cloud, we don’t need to worry about that because we are charged by the provider based on our usage of the service.

# 4. increase agility & ability
One of the challenges often faced in the on-premises model is the delay in provisioning IT infrastructure (when the purchased infrastructure arrives).
This process can take a long time. sometimes weeks or even months.

# 5. no data center required
We are no longer burdened with building our own private data center, where we have to pay for maintenance, operations, and installation which can be very expensive.
In the cloud, we don’t need to worry about such things, so we can focus on developing products that have a positive impact on the company.

# 6. go global in minutes
if we have product and want targeted global market and if we use on-premise model it will be bother because we have to build web server across region.
with cloud computing we can harness global infrastructure that already available by aws 
it will take a couple of minutes to doing provisioning IT resources and your app will be spread across the world
