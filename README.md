# Cloud-Computing

Cloud computing is an on-demand platform that delivers IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

On-demand is a service that we can request and adjust depending on our needs.

IT resources can vary in categories, such as computation, compute power, storage, databases, applications, or other IT infrastructure resources.

These IT resources are provided by big tech companies, e.g., Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. 

The internet plays a very important role, especially in on-demand services, because IT resources are offered through the internet.
With cloud services, we no longer need to worry about maintenance, hardware, or human resources.
We can request IT resources from the provider based on our needs
